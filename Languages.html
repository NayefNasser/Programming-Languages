        <i><h2>Machine Learning and Python</h2></i>
        <ul>
            <li>Python is mainly used because of ease learning and readability</li>
            <li>Python has extensive frameworks and libraries</li>
            <li>Python has large and active community of developers and researches in this fields</li>
        </ul>
